          Based on our vision of setting a global power-base which is also our supreme guide. We have as a primary mission, "To create new leaders through our school of future African leaders in politics and in business, we also aim to put new faces and ideas in leadership positions in countries around the continent."
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, we believe that development is an inside-out process, rather than outside-in process, therefore, a society cannot be called developed on the basis of infrastructure only, if its people are not fully developed. Consequently, we focus on the mind transformation of our people. As people become aware of themselves and their reality worldwide, being mentally developed, they will be able to reflect their mental development onto their environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we are aware that the world including Africa is at the time of danger and opportunity, our chance to survive depends on what type of leadership we put in charge and in which direction it is taking us. For that reason, we have an academy called 'The Free-Minded', a new school for future African leaders in politics and business. Through this education system, we will create political and business leaders who are fit for the future of Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, we are working in collaboration with all Africans around the world to design an agenda that takes into account all aspects of our respective communities and countries. In fact, we are not just creating leaders, we want to put them in positions of power in our respective communities and countries in order to fulfill our common vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we are aiming to work and strengthen our common position in order to create a continental agenda in all areas of activities for the future African generations and their leaderships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, our mission is to working with you.
