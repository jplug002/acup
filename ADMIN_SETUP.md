## Troubleshooting

### Email Issues

**Error: "SMTP credentials not configured"**
- Make sure `SMTP_USER` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` are set in your `.env` file
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

**Error: "Invalid login"**
- You're using your regular Gmail password instead of an App Password
- Generate a new App Password and use that instead

**Error: "Less secure app access"**
- Gmail no longer supports "less secure apps"
- You MUST use an App Password (see setup steps above)

### SMS Issues

**Error: "Africa's Talking API key not configured"**
- Make sure `AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
- Restart your development server

**Error: "Invalid phone number format"**
- Phone numbers must start with `+` and include country code
- Example: `+256700000000` (Uganda), `+254700000000` (Kenya)
- Users need to add their phone numbers in their profile

**Error: "Sender ID not registered"**
- In production, you need to register "ACUP" as a sender ID
- Go to Africa's Talking Dashboard > SMS > Sender IDs
- Submit "ACUP" for approval (takes 1-2 business days)

1. Add their phone number in their profile

   - Keep API keys secret

3. **Limit admin access**
